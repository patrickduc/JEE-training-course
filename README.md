# jee-tutorial
This repository contains slides (in french) of a JEE tutorial. Only persistence and EJB concepts are covered. Exercises are proposed, with simple solutions.
Slides should be read in the following order :
    * Applications n-tiers - Introduction
    * Applications n-tiers - Persistance
    * Applications n-tiers - Logique applicative
    * Applications n-tiers - Pour approfondir (not related to JEE; it presents SOAP and REST web services, and insists on the use of a logging facility).
Exercises are described in file 'Exercices.pdf".
The file "Infos pour TP.pdf" contains useful technical information to help realize the exercises.
